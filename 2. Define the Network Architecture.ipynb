The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n",

CNN's are actually learning to recognize a variety of spatial patterns and you can visualize what each convolutional layer has been trained to recognize by looking at the weights that make up each convolutional kernel and applying those one at a time to a sample image. This technique is called feature visualization and it's useful for understanding the inner workings of a CNN."

As a CNN trains, it learns what weights to include in its convolutional kernels and when these kernels are applied to some input image, they produce a set of **feature maps**. So, feature maps are just sets of filtered images; they are the images produced by applying a convolutional kernel to an input image. These maps show us the features that the different layers of the neural network learn to extract. For example, you might imagine a convolutional kernel that detects the vertical edges of a face or another one that detects the corners of eyes. You can see what kind of features each of these kernels detects by applying them to an image. One such example is shown below; from the way it brings out the lines in an the image, you might characterize this as an edge detection filter.\n",
